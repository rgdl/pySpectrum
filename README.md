# pySpectrum
A python program that applies spectrum analysis to a supplied audio file, with graphical output.

This is in its very early stages. I'm using it as a way to improve my Python skills, learn Fourier analysis, and learn to involve GitHub in my workflow. Also, once it's working I'd like to use it to help develop my music production skills, by measuring quantitative differences between reference tracks and songs I'm working on.
